It is important to note that this is indeed only an overview. In order to master this content you'll be required to read and understand Chapters 14 and 15 of our textbook. You should expect to follow along with the examples in the text as well as to pursue additional tutorials to help you implement the techniques you've learned.\n","\n","## Module Overview\n","\n","## Homework Assignments\n","\n","You must complete the following assignments associated with this module. Note that all assignments are **individual** and that collaboration is not permitted. To be clear, <u>no document or code sharing is allowed</u>. If you have questions they can be discussed during the weekly discussion meetings with me and with classmates. I've also added a Slack Channel associated with this module to BrightSpace and it is okay to have public conversations there. You should cite any sources you use outside of our textbook in completing assignments. All of the work you submit for this module must be your own -- copying and pasting from the textbook is not acceptable and no credit will be awarded for this. Simply reproducing a walkthrough or completing a web-based tutorial for the capstone section of this module will be considered academic dishonesty. Any such cases will be awarded no credit and will be reported to the Dean's Office.\n","\n","1. Create a Jupyter Notebook which will serve as your set of notes for this module. You can either build a single Jupyter Notebook which covers all chapters in the module or build a Jupyter Notebook for each chapter individually. The choice is yours.\n","    + Your notebook should give an overview of the techniques it addresses.\n","    + Your notebook should discuss scenarios when these techniques can/should be applied. What are they used for?\n","    + You should include a section on relevant terminology. All definitions presented should include your own explanations of the corresponding term. You can either provide your own detailed definition or provide a definition from a source (with citation) and accompany that definition with your own explanations and/or examples.\n","    + You should discuss any specific data requirements for the techniques being discussed. What types of data do your techniques deal with? Are there any special pre-processing requirements.\n","    + Your notebook should cover what your technique *actually does* -- how does it work? \n","    + Your notebook should discuss the results from your technique(s) and how they can be interepreted/operationalized.\n","2. You must complete the following *homework problems* corresponding to **Chapter 14**.\n","  + **Problem 1:** A university is building an advising bot to help students with course selection. The bot makes class recommendations based off of courses that a student has previously taken. The bot includes a recommendation engine which uses association rules trained on all students who have previously taken courses at the university. Interpret what is meant by the association rule: \n","  \n","  $$\\{\\text{MAT240, QSO250}\\} \\implies \\{\\text{QSO370}\\}$$\n","\n","  + **Problem 2:** Consider the following lists of courses and the two proposed association rules.

Capstone Project (see below).\n","\n","## Capstone Project\n","\n","Download the *Instacart* folder of datasets from BrightSpace. Your project will involve stitching the different datasets together via some `merge()` operations. We will discuss joining data during one of our weekly discussion groups corresponding to this module. The following capstone projects are associated with this module.\n","+ **Undergraduates (*Choose At Least One Part*), Graduates (*Complete Both Parts*):**\n","    + Perform a cluster analysis on the shoppers in the instacart database. Identify how many different *clusters* of shoppers exist within our sample data and use descriptive statistics for each cluster to engage in market segmentation and customer profiling. \n","    + Conduct a market basket analysis to build a product recommending algorithm. Your algorithm should be designed to consider items currently in a customer's cart and recommend additional products to them. In addition, you may use the *prior orders* data to construct a separate algorithm that recommends products to customers according to their (and similar customers') prior shopping trips before they have even added anything to their cart.\n","\n","All capstone submissions should take the form of a formal report. Your report should introduce the *Instacart* organization, discuss the question at hand and justify why its answer is of interest to *Instacart*, describe the data (both format and structure, as well as a true exloratory data analysis with visualization), introduce the techique(s) being used, apply the techniques, assess the results, and interpret how your algorithm can/should be implemented (being sure to include a discussion on any strengths and weeknesses). It should be clear that this capstone is a significant undertaking. This project spans the final six weeks of our semester and includes work designed to span the entirety of that time period. Please do not plan to start this project in the final one, two, or even three weeks of the semester -- you will not be successful if you procrastinate on this assignment."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8CiAwjK_DXIl"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
