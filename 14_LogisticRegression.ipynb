We applied decision tree classifiers in two cases, (i) to predict a binary response variable indicating whether or not a customer at a subscription-based firm would *churn* or not, and then (ii) a computer vision problem to classify handwritten digits -- there were 10 different classes in this second example. We saw that decision tree classifiers worked fine in both the binary and multiclass cases without changing any of our workflow. We did note, however, that a drawback to decision tree classifiers that we did not necessarily obtain a *propensity* estimate (an estimate of the probability with which we believe an observation belongs to the class it was assigned to). In this week's notebook we explore *logistic regression*, a classification model which does indeed provide us with a propensity estimate but which has the drawback of only being applicable in binary classification. We'll revisit the customer *churn* example here.\n","\n","At the beginning of last week's notebook on decision tree classifiers we noted that a linear regression model could not be applied to a classification problem. All linear regression models aside from the null model ($\\mathbb{E}\\left[y\\right] = \\beta_0$) become unbounded. Logistic regression is indeed a regression model -- it predicts a numerical output, but that numerical output is bounded between 0 and 1.\n","\n","This notebook introduces logistic regression. While logistic regression is not well-suited to the multi-class problem, it is a really common method applied to the two-class case. Logistic regression even provides some potential advantages over a more flexible model, like a tree. The output of a logistic model is a propensity for belonging to the class corresponding to an output of 1 -- the form for a logistic regression model is expressed below.\n","$$\\mathbb{P}\\left[Y = 1\\right] = \\displaystyle{\\frac{e^{\\beta_0 +\\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \\beta_k x_k}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 +\\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \\beta_k x_k}}}$$\n","\n","Notice that the exponentials are being \"raised to [one of our usual] regression models\".\n","\n","## A reminder on the `churn` data\n","\n","We are bringing back last week's first classification dataset which dealt with customer *churn*. As a reminder, churn is when an existing customer, user, player, subscriber or any kind of return client stops doing business or ends the relationship with a company. A natural goal is to figure our which customers may be most likely churn in future so that we can provide preventative outreach.\n","\n","We'll start by preparing our data in the same way it was prepared for last week's decision tree classifier."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SlzvtgN5Meem","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1605029580560,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":648,"user":{"displayName":"Adam

There's much more to learn about logistic regression and I really encourage you to read about this classifier in Chapter 10 of our textbook.\n","\n","Before we leave this topic and move to uplift and ensemble methods, there are two major takeaways you should consider here.\n","\n","+ **Weakness:** A major weakness of logistic regression models is that they are not well-suited to classification scenarios with more than two classes. There are methods for applying them to these cases though -- the easiest method is to decide that we only really care about whether an observation belongs to a single class of interest or not -- from there we have a *one-versus-all* classification problem, which is binary. If we do indeed care about differentiating all classes from one another we could engage in building a series of *one-versus-one* classifiers and then using them in a pseudo-ensemble fashion. The challenge here, however, is that even with just four classes we end up needing to work with $4\\left(3\\right)/2 = 6$ individual models.\n","+ **Strength:** Rather than outputting a *class prediction*, a logistic regression model outputs a likelihood that an observation belongs to the class represented by 1. This means that it is easy to adjust the threshold for belonging to that class -- is greater than 50% likelihood the right choice? Or would we be better off using a really strict threshold like 90%, or a really loose threshold like 20%?$^\\dagger$ Furthermore, since we are predicting a likelihood of belonging to a particular class, it is really easy to identify the predictions we are \"most certain\" about.\n","\n","<center><span style = \"font-size:8pt\"><i>$^\\dagger$How do you choose the appropriate threshold??? -- the threshold is a hyperparameter -- keep calm and cross-validate!</i></span></center>"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YRMzD4aDDlZa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1605031858836,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":602,"user":{"displayName":"Adam Gilbert","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gj1KWqLKG2SAQxx8KvqzqhM94EvqxkXs2iOw7gQWQ=s64","userId":"02074648007699947871"}},"outputId":"15f0abc4-6e90-4b0e-bb9f-a084369e844c","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"source":["log_reg_clf.predict_proba(X_safe)"],"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([[0.99489071, 0.00510929],\n","       [0.87939001, 0.12060999],\n","       [0.31844796, 0.68155204],\n","       ...,\n","       [0.93073112, 0.06926888],\n","       [0.97802079, 0.02197921],\n","       [0.82923916, 0.17076084]])"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9WL_O2qlMefN"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
