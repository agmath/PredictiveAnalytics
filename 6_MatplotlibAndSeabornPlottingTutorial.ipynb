Feature engineering is the act of creating new features (columns) from the existing columns in your data set (or from external sets, or combinations of the two). Engineering new features is a necessary skill and can be extremely fruitful when done correctly.\n","\n","Let's create a new categorical variable called `rating` which takes the levels *good* (rating at least 7), *moderate* (rating 5 to 7), and *poor* (rating less than 5). We'll engineer this feature in the original wine dataset and then resplit the training, test, and safe data. It is good practice to do this since otherwise you would need to re-engineer the feature separately for each of the sets -- not so bad for just a single engineered feature, but pretty terrible if you've engineered many."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"TBIbvFFTklwU","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["#Engineer the feature for the wineData dataset\n","\n","#Initialize the rating column with just 0's\n","wineData[\"rating\"] = 0*wineData.size\n","\n","wineData.loc[wineData[\"quality\"] >= 7, \"rating\"] = \"good\"\n","wineData.loc[(wineData[\"quality\"] >= 5) & (wineData[\"quality\"] < 7), \"rating\"] = \"moderate\"\n","wineData.loc[wineData[\"quality\"] < 5, \"rating\"] = \"poor\"\n","\n","#Print column to verify\n","#wineData[\"rating\"]\n","\n","train = wineData.iloc[train_ind, ]\n","test = wineData.iloc[test_ind, ]\n","safe = wineData.iloc[safe_ind, ]\n","\n","train.head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tvnGShJwklwY","colab_type":"text"},"source":["As you can see, we now have a rating column which lists a *good*, *moderate*, or *poor* rating for each of the wines.

You now know how to build some basic plots to explore data in all sorts of scenarios. You can go beyond these basic plots by looking up `matplotlib`'s or `seaborn`'s documentation or by doing a quick google search for how to build a particular plot type. Now it's time for you to have an opportunity to practice. There is very famous dataset on `iris` flowers available at the following web url (https://gist.githubusercontent.com/curran/a08a1080b88344b0c8a7/raw/639388c2cbc2120a14dcf466e85730eb8be498bb/iris.csv) -- use `pd.read_csv()` to read in this dataset just as we read in the `wine` dataset, and then use visualization techniques to explore relationships between petal and sepal widths and lengths across three varieties of iris. Don't forget to split your new data into training, test, and safe sets like we did with the `wine` data."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2PBs_2fQklwd","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
