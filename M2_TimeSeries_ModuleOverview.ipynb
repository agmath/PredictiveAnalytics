It is important to note that this is indeed only an overview. In order to master this content you'll be required to read and understand Chapters 16, 17 and 18 of our textbook. You should expect to follow along with the examples in the text as well as to pursue additional tutorials to help you implement the techniques you've learned.\n","\n","## Module Overview\n","\n","## Assignments\n","\n","Note that all assignments are **individual** and that collaboration is not permitted. To be clear, <u>no document or code sharing is allowed</u>. If you have questions they can be discussed during the weekly discussion meetings with me and with classmates. I've also added a channel associated with this module to Slack and it is okay to have public conversations there. You should cite any sources you use outside of our textbook in completing assignments. All of the work you submit for this module must be your own -- copying and pasting from the textbook is not acceptable and no credit will be awarded for this. Simply reproducing a walkthrough or completing a web-based tutorial for the capstone section of this module will be considered academic dishonesty. Any such cases will be awarded no credit and will be reported to the Dean's Office.\n","\n","The assignments associated with this module appear below.\n","\n","1. Create a Jupyter Notebook which will serve as your set of notes for this module. You can either build a single Jupyter Notebook which covers all chapters in the module or build a Jupyter Notebook for each chapter individually. The choice is yours.\n","    + Your notebook should give an overview of the techniques it addresses.\n","    + Your notebook should discuss scenarios when these techniques can/should be applied. What are they used for?\n","    + You should include a section on relevant terminology. All definitions presented should include your own explanations of the corresponding term. You can either provide your own detailed definition or provide a definition from a source (with citation) and accompany that definition with your own explanations and/or examples.\n","    + You should discuss any specific data requirements for the techniques being discussed. What types of data do your techniques deal with? Are there any special pre-processing requirements.\n","    + Your notebook should cover what your technique *actually does* -- how does it work? \n","    + Your notebook should discuss the results from your technique(s) and how they can be interepreted/operationalized.\n","2. You must complete the following *homework problems*.\n","    + **<u>Chapter 16:</u>** \n","        + **Problem 1:** Describe the unique challenges that time series applications present when considering how we split our data into training and validation (test and safe) sets.\n","        + **Problem 2:** Identify each of the following applications as time series or not. Be sure to justify your choice. \n","          + a) Predicting customer volume from week to week for a restaurant.\n","          + b) Predicting the selling price of a home using the selling prices of comparable homes over the last two months.\n","          + c) Predicting the starting salary of an individual based off of their gender, number of years of schooling, highest degree attained, and number of years of relevant work experience.\n","          + d) Predicting minute-by-minute demand (total bit-rate) for a streaming service.\n","    + **<u>Chapter 17:</u>**\n","        + **Problem 1:** In which of the following is there likely to be a seasonal effect? Be sure to justify.\n","          + a) Predicting the starting salary of an individual taking a new job.\n","          + b) Predicting weekly sales of sweaters.\n","          + c) Predicting energy demand for households each month.\n","          + d) Predicting number of customers attending a movie theater each week.\n","        + **Problem 2:** Decribe autocorrelation in your own words. Include a discussion about the challenges that autocorrelation presents.\n","    + **<u>Chapter 18:</u>**\n","        + **Problem 1:** An analyst uses a centered window to smooth for a forecasting application -- what is wrong about this?\n","        + **Problem 2:** For a given time series of sales, we train on 38 months. The first six months are seen below. \n","          + a) Compute the sales forecast for July `19 based on a moving average with $w = 4$.\n","          + b) Compute the forcasting error for your July `19 forecast.\n","\n","*Month*      | *Sales*\n","-------------|--------\n","February `19 | 18\n","March `19    | 22\n","April `19    | 28\n","May `19      | 27\n","June `19     | 31\n","July `19     | 34\n","\n","3. Capstone Project (see below).\n","\n","## Capstone Project\n","\n","Download the *Walmart* folder of datasets from BrightSpace. All projects will involve stitching the different datasets together via some `merge()` operations. We will discuss joining data during one of our weekly discussion groups corresponding to this module. The following capstone projects are associated with this module.\n","+ Your goal here is pretty easy to explain -- build a model that helps *Walmart* predict demand for its individual products. The content you've encountered through the *Time Series* module will serve you well here!\n","\n","All capstone submissions should take the form of a formal report. Your report should introduce the *Walmart* organization, discuss the question at hand and justify why its answer is of interest to *Walmart*, describe the data (both format and structure, as well a true exloratory data analysis with visualization), introduce the techique(s) being used, apply the techniques, assess the results, and interpret how your forecasting model can/should be implemented (being sure to include a discussion on any strengths and weaknesses). It should be clear that this capstone is a significant undertaking. This project spans the final six weeks of our semester and includes work designed to span the entirety of that time period. Please do not plan to start this project in the final one, two, or even three weeks of the semester -- you will not be successful if you procrastinate on this assignment."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Wr_BarDwDihV"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
